## First
* Open the Advance Editor and paste the code from the [Script](https://github.com/doug-pires/Power-BI/blob/515f2da9e5f1058401b1109e6bfcce88d7432052/Last%20Refresh/Last%20Refresh%20UTC%20M%20Code.pq)

## Third
* Upload the table to your model and create the measures to inform the Last Refresh, like I did in the following [DAX Measure](https://github.com/doug-pires/Power-BI/blob/389ed2d8e3e7ceb767d77736d2cf09d48f00fd3d/Last%20Refresh/DAX%20Last%20Refresh%20UTC.dax). 
Done!
>In Power Query you  can put your parameters as List of Values as well.

>You can change the message in your DAX code.

**Feel free to update this code as per your business needs.**
